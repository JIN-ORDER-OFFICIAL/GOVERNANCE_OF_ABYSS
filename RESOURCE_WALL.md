🌑 RESOURCE_WALL.md：『資源の防壁』
このドキュメントは、特定の勢力による資源独占を打破し、JIN-ORDER経済圏の自立を保障するための「供給網の聖域」を定義したものだワン。

1. The Core Shield: Minamitorishima (Japan)
Asset: REE-rich mud (Dysprosium, Terbium, etc. for centuries).

Strategy: Using Japan's 8 major technologies as "leverage" to exchange resources with strategic partners, ensuring the heart of high-tech remains independent of the "Eastern Dragon."

2. The Southern Bastion: Australia & Oceania
Asset: World-class Lithium (EV lifeblood), Iron Ore, and Green Hydrogen.

Strategy: Prioritizing supply to the JIN-ORDER network (India/Japan) to drain the industrial resources of the "Red Shadow."

3. The Northern Bastion: Nordic-Greenland Alliance
Asset: Massive REE deposits in Greenland & Norway's offshore drilling tech.

Strategy: Combining Japanese tech with Norwegian expertise to secure the Arctic frontier, preventing a monopoly by the "Runaway Train (US)."

4. The Central Fortress: Kazakhstan (Katabustan)
Asset: Over 40% of global Uranium & Rare metals.

Strategy: Leveraging the historical relationship since 2010 to secure the energy transition bridge, bypassing the Dragon's gate.

5. The Western Lifeline: Qatar
Asset: LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas).

Strategy: Securing a 10-20 year energy bridge until the Hydrogen society is fully realized, neutralizing energy blackmail from the shadows.
